# FeatureCloud CLI
This pip package offers a CLI that is intended to be used with the [FeatureCloud](https://featurecloud.ai/) privacy-preserving platform for federated learning and data-analysis.
Its purpose is to speed up app development of FeatureCloud apps by providing a CLI tool for common operations related to development as well as providing a library for all necessary communication in federated learning.

## Test Workflow command
Implementing flexible non-linear workflows in FeatureCloud platform

### FeatureCloud Workflow
In FeatureCloud, end-users and developers can run linear workflow in the front-end website at [https://featurecloud.ai](https://featurecloud.ai/).
They can assemble a workflow and run different apps in a linear fashion where each app will be executed after another.
Results of each app will be provided for the next one in the workflow while the results should be in the right format and extension 
which is acceptable for the upcoming app. Any workflows may involve different number of clients(data owners) who want to collaborate 
in the federated fashion, using one or more applications. Even though the online workflow serves all the needs of end-users,
developers may have challenges to flexibly employ different apps in nonlinear fashion to come-up with new solutions.
FeatureCloud developers can range from app developers who will implement federated apps that are extended version of centralized,
or the ones that are introduced originally to address federated challenges. The Latter is concerned with researchers
in various fields of science which makes it significantly trickier. In fact, developers may need arbitrary operations 
on data and results for to discover the right solution which may involve pre-/post-processing apps or operations.
Long story short, here we introduce FeatureCloud test workflow, where developers can assemble an arbitrary workflow for research purposes.
Such test workflows, are not supported in the app store, and once the developers came with final solution, they ought to 
present it as an app that may be run in conjunction of other apps in a workflow. In FC test workflow, each app will be run as 
a test app in the test-bed. Accordingly, all the functionalities are applied to the test-run that runs a specific app.

### Methods

#### Set apps test ID
`def set_id(self, test_id: int)`: Set the app's test ID and partially define the delete method based on it.

#### Extract the results (zip files)
 `def extract_results(self, def_res_file: str)`: extract app's results zip files for all clients into their corresponding directories

#### Wait for the end of app execution
`def wait_until_finishes(self)`: Waits until the app status becomes finished.

#### Check the app is finished or not
`def is_finished(self)`: Check either the app status is finished.

#### Create and remove directories
`def clean_dirs(self, def_re_dir: str)`: creates results directories. And removes existing results in the directories

#### Generate paths to data and results dirs
`def create_paths(self, ctrl_data_path: str, ctrl_test_path: str)`: Generate paths to directories containing the app's data(for each client)
And also for app's results.
```
Parameters
----------
ctrl_data_path: str
    path to the target controller's data folder
ctrl_test_path: str
    path to the target controller's tests folder
```
#### Copy final results, as data for the next app.
`def copy_results(self, ctrl_data_path: str, dest_generic: str, dest_clients: list, default_res_name: str)`:
Copy results of the app to as the data to the directory of the next app.

```
Parameters
----------
ctrl_data_path: str
    path to the target controller's data folder
dest_generic: str
    Full path to directory containing
    the generic data of the next app in the workflow
dest_clients: str
    Full path to directory containing
    the clients' data of the next app in the workflow
default_res_name: str
    Default name for the app's result directory
    Same name for all clients.

```

### TestWorkFlow
The TestWorkFlow class is an abstract class that provides basic functionalities for general workflows.
It asks developers to extend it and implement run() and register_app methods.
#### Attributes
##### apps
It includes a list of instances of TestApp class as apps that should be run in the workflow.
The order of registering apps will be preserved, however, developers can run them in any arbitrary manner.
##### controller
An instance of Controller class that helps developers to have same operations for all running test-runs with different apps.
##### default_res_dir_name
It is a name for the result directory that contains all extracted results from the zip file for each client in each app.
This directory provides the data for the upcoming app. 
#### Methods
 
##### Registering an app: `def register_app(self)`
This abstract method should be implemented by developers to register apps into the workflow. The apps will be added to the `self.apps`
list and will be available in the run method to be executed.

##### Running the workflow: `def run(self)`
It is another abstract method tha should be implemented by developers to run the workflow.
Developers can implement an arbitrary flow of app execution when they have access to the data and results of each app.

##### Registering a TestApp instance `def register(self, app)`
Adding `TestApp` instance to the app list and logging the apps attributes.

##### Stopping all running apps on the WF's controller: `def stop(self)`
Stop all test-runs in the controller.
##### Deleting all the running containers in the WF: `def delete(self)`
Delete all test-runs in the controller.

##### Getting information of all running test-runs in the WF's controller: `def info(self, format: str)`
info of all tests in the specified controller or all of them.

### Tips for implementing and running workflows
For implementing a desired workflow, developers should extend `TestWorkFlow` class and implement `register_apps` and `run` methods.
The name of the extended class should always be `WorkFlow` and it asks for the controller address, channel, and query interval for querying the controller.
After implementing the workflow, developers can run it using FeatureCloud pip package:

```shell
sudo featurecloud test workflow start --wf-dir <WORKFLOW_FILE_Path> --wf-file <NAME> --controller-host <CONTROLLER> --channel <> --query-interval <>
```

Beware that due to the file permissions, the workflow should be run using supper-user access.
ALl the data and results will be available in the controller's data directory. In fact, data for the first app should be provided 
in `app{app_n}` folder. Where `app_n` is the index the target app in WF's `apps` list. The same numbering applies for all the registered
apps, and results will be directly moved into the next app's directory. Even though the controller write result zip
files in `tests` directory, for each app, the extracted results will be available in corresponding app folder in `data` directory.
